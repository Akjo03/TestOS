# TestOS

This is a simple OS written in Rust.

## Tools Folder

To work with this project, you need to have a folder under the root of the project called `tools`. This folder needs to have the following structure:

- `tools/`
  - `qemu/`
    - `...` (QEMU files)
  - `nasm.exe`

## Usage

Just run the run configuration in RustRover, and it will build and run the OS in QEMU.
